The choice between using .card or .container in your media queries depends on the specific needs of your project.

If you're styling individual card elements that need to change size at different viewport widths, then using .card in your media queries, as in your current code, is appropriate.

On the other hand, if you're trying to control the overall layout of your page and want to change the width of a container that holds multiple elements, then using .container in your media queries would be more appropriate.

In general, it's common to use both types of media queries in a project: one set for the overall layout (using a class like .container), and another set for individual elements (like .card). This allows you to control the layout at a high level while also fine-tuning the appearance of individual elements.
